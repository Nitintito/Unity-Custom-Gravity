# About
This project started when i replayd Mario Galaxy and got intrested in doing spherical gravity for myself. 
I started doing som research and stumbled upon the web site Catlike Coding (by Jasper Flick). Using his tutorial as a base i have started adding difrent gravity shapes and updated the movement system.
